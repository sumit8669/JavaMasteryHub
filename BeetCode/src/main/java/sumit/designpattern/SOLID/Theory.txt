SOLID Principles Overview
S - Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)
A class should have only one reason to change.
O - Open/Closed Principle (OCP)
Software entities should be open for extension but closed for modification.
L - Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)
Subtypes must be substitutable for their base types without altering program behavior.
I - Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)
Clients should not be forced to depend on interfaces they do not use.
D - Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)
High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions.
